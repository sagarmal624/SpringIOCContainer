The Spring IoC Container creates, configures and connects the objects (which are called Beans), then manage their life cycle.
The IoC container is responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects. The IoC container gets informations from the XML file and works accordingly. The main tasks performed by IoC container are:

to instantiate the application class
to configure the object
to assemble the dependencies between the objects
There are two types of IoC containers. They are:

1)BeanFactory
2) ApplicationContext
